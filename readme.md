# [WEBANALYZER] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [TEAM ZEN]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [J J ARYA] - [CUSAT]
- Member 2: [ATHUL V] - [CUSAT]


### Project Description
[Webalyzer is a Flask-based web tool that simulates a spider‚Äôs behavior by analyzing spider webs through a playful and interactive UI.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[How do spiders keep analyzing their webs if we don‚Äôt make an app for them?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A web app (so spiders don‚Äôt need to download anything!) that allows them to upload pictures of their webs.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [ Python, HTML, CSS]
- [Flask]
- [OpenCV]
- [Any code editor (VS Code recommended), Python environment]

For Hardware:
-None (Purely software/web app)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[pip install -r requirements.txt]

# Run
[python app.py]

### Project Documentation
For Software: Tagline : Because even spiders deserve good software...

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
