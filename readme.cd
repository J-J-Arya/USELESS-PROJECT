Project Description
Webalyzer is a Flask-based web tool that simulates a spider‚Äôs behavior by analyzing spider webs through a playful and interactive UI.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do spiders keep analyzing their webs if we don‚Äôt make an app for them?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A web app (so spiders don‚Äôt need to download anything!) that allows them to upload pictures of their webs.
The app:

Analyzes the image

Counts the number of closed loops

Estimates how many flies might get caught based on that

Pretty useful, isn‚Äôt it? üï∑
