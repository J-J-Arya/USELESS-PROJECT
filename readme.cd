📝 Project Description:
Webalyzer is a Flask-based web tool that simulates a spider’s behavior by analyzing spider webs through a playful and interactive UI.

It includes:

-A splash screen

-CAPTCHA-style spider verification

-Image upload & web analysis

-Output prediction based on closed loops in the web

❓ Problem
How do spiders keep analyzing their webs if we don’t make an app for them?

💡 Solution
A web app (so spiders don’t need to download anything!) that allows them to upload pictures of their webs.

The app:

-Analyzes the image

-Counts the number of closed loops

-Estimates how many flies might get caught based on that

-Pretty useful, isn’t it? 🕷️


⚙️ Technical Details
Technologies Used:

-Flask (Python) – for the backend & routing

-OpenCV – for image processing

-HTML/CSS  – for the UI
